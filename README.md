# Decentralized Fact-Checking with NLP and Blockchain

This project implements a decentralized fact-checking system designed to address the biases and transparency issues inherent in centralized fact-checking platforms. Users can submit claims (e.g., news headlines) along with supporting evidence. An NLP model cross-verifies these claims against trusted sources (e.g., scientific papers, WHO reports). Validators in the community vote on the outcomes, and tokenized incentives are issued to reward accurate validations.

## Features

- **Decentralized Claims Submission:**  
  Users can submit claims and supporting evidence, which are recorded on a blockchain.

- **NLP-Based Verification:**  
  A fine-tuned NLP model evaluates the claim against trusted evidence sources and assigns a truth score.

- **Community Voting:**  
  Validators can vote on the NLP results, contributing to community consensus.

- **Tokenized Incentives:**  
  Rewards are distributed in the form of tokens to encourage accurate validations.

- **Dashboard Interface:**  
  A Streamlit dashboard for submitting claims, viewing current claims, voting, and monitoring token balances.
